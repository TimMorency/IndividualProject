Writing a journal for week one of Java EE 
Still very foggy with the IDE stuff, i think it will take me time to understand it but it seems very interesting.
Github is kinda like something i use at work, salesforce has a queue task system thats like this but it doesnt allow for the simultaneous 
editing which makes github super cool.
I am having trouble what to decide on to do for my project too. Seems like it is just to much to decide. I think im going to make a 
Graphing process.
