Writing a journal for week one of Java EE 
Still very foggy with the IDE stuff, i think it will take me time to understand it but it seems very interesting.
Github is kinda like something i use at work, salesforce has a queue task system thats like this but it doesnt allow for the simultaneous 
editing which makes github super cool.
I am having trouble what to decide on to do for my project too. Seems like it is just to much to decide. I think im going to make a 
Graphing process.

week2
Found out about something that could be of big use to me with my project. It's a javascript library called charts.js
its incredible so much better for editing and having graphs on your site. Also i worked with logging in class and setup tomcat. 
I use logging a lot at work so i feel a lot more comfortable with it, also the more i use everything at work the more i can relate it to 
everything we use in my classes.
Planning on working with everything to make a chatroom esque kinda thing where you can set up 5v5 games or 1v1 tournaments and 
post scores and if i feel i can do it maybe even replays.

week 3 
Starting to write out the html for my project soon, im worried that iwont be able to keep up with this class its a lot to get done
in a short amount of time i have to wrok with throughout the week. My plans are to work on the project twice a week, an hour after my 
AJAX class and the early time before i get into school on wednesday for java.
I Am about to start the exercises for DAO, and i am re reading all of the readings to make sure i have everything right.

week 4
took a week to rest and complete projects for other classes after completing the code review

week 5 
tried to add the login functionality to my project still struggling with it.

week 6 
Reading into the riot games api to make sure i know how to use it for my projects, the message boards on their site are very nice and helpful.
