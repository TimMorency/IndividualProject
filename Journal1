Writing a journal for week one of Java EE 
Still very foggy with the IDE stuff, i think it will take me time to understand it but it seems very interesting.
Github is kinda like something i use at work, salesforce has a queue task system thats like this but it doesnt allow for the simultaneous 
editing which makes github super cool.
I am having trouble what to decide on to do for my project too. Seems like it is just to much to decide. I think im going to make a 
Graphing process.

week2
Found out about something that could be of big use to me with my project. It's a javascript library called charts.js
its incredible so much better for editing and having graphs on your site. Also i worked with logging in class and setup tomcat. 
I use logging a lot at work so i feel a lot more comfortable with it, also the more i use everything at work the more i can relate it to 
everything we use in my classes.
Planning on working with everything to make a chatroom esque kinda thing where you can set up 5v5 games or 1v1 tournaments and 
post scores and if i feel i can do it maybe even replays.
