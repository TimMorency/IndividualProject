So for my project i'd like to create a graph, for a lot of fantasy sports sites there are a ton of stats except it really only shows 
the numbers, id like to create a webservice that makes a graph of two data sets entered into it. So like you enter two labels 
and two sets of data. then on the map it creates a picture of what the data looks like.
